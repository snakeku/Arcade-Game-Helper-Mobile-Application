## [Introduction](#introduction)

The project was created as a way to challenge oneself and improve skills in machine learning, mobile app development, and object detection. Additionally, the idea of creating a tool to help people win a challenging arcade game was an exciting and motivating prospect.

This mobile application was created for fun and personal development. The goal of the project is to utilize machine learning vision to assist the player in winning an arcade game that requires precise timing.

## [Functionality](#functionality)

The application utilizes custom object detection to detect the position of the 12 o'clock mark and when the light lands on it. Once it lands on it, it starts a timer as it goes through one oscillation clockwise, and the timer ends when it lands back at the 12 o'clock mark. This information will be useful for players who suspect that the game may have been rigged to change the timing of the oscillation.

The app will tell how long one oscillation takes, and assuming if 1 coin insert takes 1 second to stop the light, it will advise when to insert the coin.

## Currently under development. Will Share once it is done

## [How to Use](#how)
1. Open the Arcade Game Helper Mobile Application on your mobile device.<br><br>
2. Point your device's camera at the arcade game.<br><br>
3. The app will detect the game and provide you with a signal when it's time to insert the coin.<br><br>
4. Insert the coin when prompted by the app.<br><br>
5. If the light stops at the 12 o'clock position, the app will start the timer.<br><br>
6. Wait for the light to complete one oscillation and land back on the 12 o'clock position.<br><br>
7. The app will display the duration of one oscillation, and you can use this information to adjust your timing for the next round.<br><br>
